# About our project
We started the instgram project report with a simple introduction and a background of meta company and a definition of some of the problems
that the application solves and how it solves them.then we wrote a work plan using the incremental model and agile methodology,
and functional requirements and non-functional requirements in two ways (user and system).
then we analyzed the system using four UML models, which are 1-activity diagram, 2-use case modding, 3-sequence diagram, 4-class diagram .
Finally, we made a simplified presentation of the content of the report.
